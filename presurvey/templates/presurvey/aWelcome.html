        Today, we invite you to take part in an economic experiment. The experiment is part of a research
        project of doctoral students at the Poznan University of Economics and Business (PUEB). In total,
        approximately 500-600 students will participate. All sessions will take place in December 2022.<br>

        <br>By participating in this experiment, you support their research.<br>

        The experiment will take about <b>20 minutes</b>.<br>
        Every participant who takes part and answers all questions receives a <b>show-up fee of 5 Zloty</b>.<br>
        In addition, there is the <b>chance to earn another 5 Zloty</b> during the experiment.<br>
        The outcome of the experiment has an impact on the study conditions at PUEB.<br>

        <br><strong>Please do not talk to your fellow students during the experiment.</strong>
