        Assume that the university provided every student at PUEB with 15 Zloty.
        This money is earmarked for improving study conditions at this university.
        It can be spent on the following options:<br>
    <br>
    (I)     A series of presentations by well-known Polish-born entrepreneurs<br><br>
    (II)    Online access to important standard textbooks as ebooks via university WiFi. <br><br>
    (III)   Scholarships (600-800 Zloty per student) for study or internships abroad.<br><br>
    (IV)	Financial support for Study Circles at PUEB. <br><br>

<br><b>How should this money be distributed (in percentage?)</b><br>

    <br>Please note that your answer is purely hypothetical. It does not have any real-life consequences.<br>

    <br>Please make sure that all of the options below add up to 100.
You only need to fill in the number <b>without</b> the percentage sign "%".
