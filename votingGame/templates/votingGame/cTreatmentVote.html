    In your group, the decision about how to spent the 10-15 Zloty per student is made in majority voting. <br><br>

    The option that receives the absolute majority of votes is chosen and the 10-15 Zloty of every group member is
    spent on this option. In case there is no majority, the two options that receive most votes will enter
    a run-off election. In the unlikely case of a tie, one of the two options is chosen at random.<br><br>

    Note: <b>The decision now has real-life consequences.</b> The decision reached in your group will be executed.
    <b>For every student participating in your group, 10-15 Zloty per person will be spent on the option
    that receives the majority.</b><br>
    Now please cast your vote.<br><br>

    What should the 10-15 Zloty per member of your group be spent on?<br><br>
