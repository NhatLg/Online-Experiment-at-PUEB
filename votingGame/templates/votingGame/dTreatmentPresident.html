    For the 10-15 Zloty per student in your group, we asked <i>Wiktoria Walkowiak</i> <b>the president</b> of the student council
        at your university to make the decision on what the money is spent.
        These were the options:<br><br>
        <ul>
            <li> A presentation by Marek Zmys≈Çowski, Polish-born entrepreneur and co-founder of Rocket Internet,
                RTB House, OLX and GLOVO. </li><br>
            <li> Online access to important standard textbooks via university WiFi. </li><br>
            <li> Scholarships (600-800 Zloty per student) for study or internship abroad outside of funded programs. </li><br>
            <li> Financial support of selected Study Circles (e.g. for publications or conferences). </li><br>
        </ul>
        <br>The president <i>Wiktoria Walkowiak</i> decided as follows<br>
        For every member of your group, 10-15 Zloty are spent on the following option:<br><br>

        <b>Scholarships (600-800 Zloty per student) for study or internship abroad outside of funded programs.</b>
