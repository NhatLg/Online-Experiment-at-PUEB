        <b>For every participant</b> of today’s experiment, there are 10-15 Zloty from public sources.
        This money is earmarked for improving study conditions at the PUEB.
        It can be spent on the following options:<br><br>
        <ul>
            <li> Additional funds for the annual competition for the best master's or bachelor's thesis </li><br>
            <li> Scholarships (800-1000 Zloty per student) for study or internships abroad  </li><br>
            <li> Online Access to important standard textbooks via university WiFi </li><br>
            <li> Financial support for selected Study Circles </li><br>
        </ul>
        The question is: <b>What should the 10-15 Zloty per student be spent on?</b><br><br>

        We randomly divided all participants in today’s experiments into 3 groups of about equal size. <br>
        <b>Please do not communicate with each other when answering the upcoming questions.</b><br>
        If you have problem, please raise your hand so the experimenter can help you.<br>
