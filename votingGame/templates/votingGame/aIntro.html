        <b>For every participant</b> of today’s experiment, there are 10-15 Zloty from public sources.
        This money is earmarked for improving study conditions at the Poznan University of Economics and Business.
        It can be spent on the following options:<br><br>
        <ul>
            <li> A presentation by Marek Zmysłowski, Polish-born entrepreneur and co-founder of Rocket Internet,
                RTB House, OLX and GLOVO and author of the bestseller "Chasing Black Unicorns." </li><br>
            <li> Access to a collection of important standard textbooks as ebooks accessible to all students
                when logged in to the university WiFi.  </li><br>
            <li> A number of scholarships (600-800 Zloty per student) for study abroad or internship abroad outside
                of funded programs (so-called free mover). </li><br>
            <li> Financial support of selected Study Circles to support their activities,
                among others publications and conferences. </li><br>
        </ul>
        The question is: <b>What should the 10-15 Zloty per student be spent on?</b><br><br>

        We randomly divided all participants in today’s experiments into three groups of about equal size. <br>
        <b>Please do not communicate with each other when answering the upcoming questions.</b><br>
        If you have problem, please raise your hand so the experimenter can help you.<br>
