        <b>For every participant</b> of today’s experiment, there are 10-15 Zloty from public sources.
        This money is earmarked for improving study conditions at the PUEB.
        It can be spent on the following options:<br><br>
        <ul>
            <li> A presentation by Marek Zmysłowski, Polish-born entrepreneur and co-founder of Rocket Internet,
                RTB House, OLX and GLOVO. </li><br>
            <li> Online access to important standard textbooks via university WiFi. </li><br>
            <li> Scholarships (600-800 Zloty per student) for study or internship abroad outside of funded programs. </li><br>
            <li> Financial support of selected Study Circles (e.g. for publications or conferences). </li><br>
        </ul>
        The question is: <b>What should the 10-15 Zloty per student be spent on?</b><br><br>

        We randomly divided all participants in today’s experiments into two groups of about equal size. <br>
        <b>Please do not communicate with each other when answering the upcoming questions.</b><br>
        If you have problem, please raise your hand so the experimenter can help you.<br>
