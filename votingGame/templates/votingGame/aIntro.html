        For every participant of today’s experiment, there are 10 Zloty from public sources.
        This money is earmarked for improving study conditions at the Poznan University of Economics and Business. It can be spent on the following options:
        <ul>
            <li> A presentation the famous entrepreneur Marek Zmysłowski (firm(s), +1-2 facts) </li>
            <li> Access to a collection of standard textbooks in English language (ebooks) for every student </li>
            <li> Scholarships for study abroad (or internship abroad) outside of funded programs (i.e. free mover). </li>
            <li> Installation/Support of a study circle [Here, we need to be more precise]. </li>
        </ul>
        The question is: What should the 10 Zloty per student be spent on?
