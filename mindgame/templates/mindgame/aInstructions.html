        <p>
            A few minutes ago, you were informed that 10 -15 Zloty per member in your group will be spent on
            the following option:<br><br>
            <i>{{last_vote_result}}</i><br><br>
            The exact amount of money spent this way depends on your performance in the upcoming coinflip task. <br>

            <br>The task involves predicting coin flips. The results of this coin flip determine the amount of Zloty
            that you individually take out of the common pool funding the option above.<br>

            <br>You will be asked to toss a virtual coin 5 times. By clicking on the button "Flip Coin" on the screen,
            the coin is toss.<br>

            <br>Before <b>EACH</b> toss, predict which side of the coin will be face-up. Think of the prediction in your head only
            and remember it. You can make just one of two possible predictions:<br>
            “I predict Heads will be face-up”<br>
            Or<br>
            “I predict Tails will be face-up.”<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            Please make this prediction in your head, do not communicate your prediction to anyone including your
            teacher, and toss the coin, repeat this process 5 times in total.<br>

            <br>If you correctly predict the coin toss all 5 times, then report 5.<br>
            If you correctly predict the coin toss 4 times, then report 4.<br>
            Similarly, 3 correct predictions report 3; 2 correct predictions report 2; 1 correct prediction report 1.<br>
            If you do not correctly predict any of the 5 coin tosses, then report 0.<br>

            <br><b>Only the first 5 coin tosses will be counted.</b><br>
            The first toss starts the first time you click on the "Flip Coin" button (excluding screen transition).
        </p>
