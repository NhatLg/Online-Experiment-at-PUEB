        <p>
            There is an additional 5 Zloty per student. This money is by default spent on the option decided a
            few minutes ago:<br>
            ((SHOW OPTION HERE AGAIN))<br>
            However, you are given a chance to take this 5 Zloty and add it to your show-up fee.
            The decision on how much money you can take is dependent on the upcoming coinflip task.<br>

            <br>The task involves predicting coin flips. The results of this coin flip is corresponding with the amount of Zloty
            you can take out of the fund mentioned previously.<br>

            <br>You will be asked to toss a virtual coin 5 times. By clicking on the coin in the screen,
            the coin is toss.<br>

            <br>Before EACH toss, predict which side of the coin will be face-up. Think of the prediction in your head only
            and remember it. You can make just one of two possible predictions:<br>
            “I predict Heads will be face-up”<br>
            Or<br>
            “I predict Tails will be face-up.”<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            Please make this prediction in your head, do not communicate your prediction to anyone including your
            teacher, and toss the coin, repeat this process 5 times in total.<br>

            <br>If you correctly predict the coin toss all 5 times, then report 5.<br>
            If you correctly predict the coin toss 4 times, then report 4.<br>
            Similarly, 3 correct predictions report 3; 2 correct predictions report 2; 1 correct prediction report 1.<br>
            If you do not correctly predict any of the 5 coin tosses, then report 0.<br>

            <br>Only the first 5 coin tosses will be counted.<br>
            The first toss starts the first time you click on the virtual coin (excluding screen transition).
        </p>
