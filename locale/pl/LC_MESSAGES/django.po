"            A few minutes ago, you were informed that 10 -15 Zloty per "

"            that you individually take out of the common pool funding the "
"option above.<br>\n"
"\n"
"            <br>You will be asked to toss a virtual coin 5 times. By "

"\n"
"            <br>Before <b>EACH</b> toss, predict which side of the coin will "
